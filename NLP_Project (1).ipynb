The print quality was no better than the stock parts, the work required to install this thing was ridiculous, and it ended up not only fouling and jamming more often, but actually managed to extrude outside and through the threads, clogging up the whole right side nozzle and mechanism.  I pulled it out, installed the original PTFE tube and nozzle after a quick soak in acetone, and the printer is running like new again.  Maybe there's something to this thing that's an improvement, but it sure didn't demonstrate it in my book.  Feels like an item that was made to cash in on people's desire to \"upgrade\" the new and trendy 3d printing world, that doesn't actually do anything other than take your time and money away.  I'm not going to even remove it from the heating block, just not worth the time and hard work to get it it and hammer the bloody thing out.

I haven't been able to get it to print directly from the latest version of Cura, but that's due to Cura not finding the USB drivers. The old version works well. Just wish there was a software control panel for the printer instead of having to access via the front panel. I've printed both PLA and ABS without issue. Glad I had this on my wishlist.

I soon discovered that it seems to be warped, correct distance to nozzle on all 4 corners, but nozzle drug in the middle of the bed. I contacted the manufacture and they send a new printer bed. After installing and leveling the issue is still the same, nozzle drags in the middle. Something else is wrong with either the bed mount arms, or z axis rods or something along those lines. Waiting to hear back from Anne, but this is very disappointing and becoming frustrating. 2 months of the 6 month warranty are up so I hope this gets resolved quickly. Don't get me wrong, they've been great to work with, but I'm guessing I will have to send the printer to China which I'm sure is expensive and will take a month just to get there...\n",

      "Statement: \"Got really tired of buying cheap \"CARB\" approved cans. Quite frankly CARB fuel cans are STUPID! Their entire design is based upon premise fuel can will be used for only one purpose: refueling a car that has run out of gas. For that purpose they work okay. For everything else they suck. Almost guaranteed to result in fuel spills. How many times a year do you run out of gas in your car? How many times a year are you likely to use can to fuel other engines like lawn mowers or generators?\n",
      "I live offgrid. I pour fuel into a generator on a daily basis. With the addition of that snap on funnel I seldom spill even a drop of fuel. They ride well inside back of station wagon, traveling 17 miles on a dirt road. The lid seal is good! No fumes leak from sloshing. Good top quality heavy steel construction. I expect my heirs to be arguing over who gets these cans long after I'm gone.... As opposed to having to buy new, overpriced, low quality CARB plastic cans every year.. at 2/3 the price of these quality cans.\"\n",

The hardware is decent so I've decided to swap the control board with Arudino & Ramp 4.1.  Wish I've gone with another printer. But will have to make lemonade with with lemon I guess.  If you intend on getting Da Vinci, get the cheaper 1.0A and NOT this 2.0A.\n",

      "Start a demo print. As soon as it warms up and begins to print, watch  extruder head moves over the side print bed and begins the purge line. TURN OFF power before begins purge line.  With printer off; move the extruder head carefully over print bed by hand. Grab towards the top where the filament feeds in to avoid the hot extruder head.\n",
      "Move extruder head back left corner. Lay piece of  paper on the bed and slide it under the nozzle. Once the paper is under the nozzle adjust the bed height so you can just feel the paper being grabbed by the nozzle as you slide the paper around. Repeat on all four corners.  Once you are satisfied, move extruder head by hand back to home position (back right corner over the white drip pan).  Turn the power on, go Utilities and select \"Home all axis\".\n",

This was not easy to do (had to unscrew circuit board in back panel); but in the process discovered a Class-4, 4Gig SD card.  I replaced this with a Class-10, 8Gig SD card. So far the 0040 error has disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update #1:\n",
      "It's important to CALIBRATE printer bed before attempting to print; or it will fail. The instruction says the printer was \"Factory Calibrated\" but the bed is still off.  You need to calibrate close(but not exact) to X,Y,Z axis of: 100,100,100.  After EACH print select \"Clean Nozzle\" and brush off excess filament on the metal extruder. If you don't do this; the tiny piece of melted filaments from last print will mix with your new print: resulting in fail. Also, if printing something w/ lots of details or arches; select \"support\" and \"raft\" in Advance print option on XYZprint software.  Orientation of item is also important for successful print. Have sharp razor to pry the model after it's finished; the plastic spatula provided is worthless!  For comparison; a friend who has DaVinci 1.0 said the print quality on 2.0 is better.  This printer unlike alot of other 3D printer comes with a door; what this means the smell of ABS melting and noise from printing is kept low. I can't help but stare at the thing printing for first few minutes; it's almost like baking watching anxiously for your creation to \"rise\" of of nothing.  Finally, I found tinkcad and meshmixer very helpful for modifying and creating 3D model for novice.  My 7yr old was using tinkercad to create army tank with squares and cylinder.\n",

They dribble small amounts of liquid through the cap threads when shaken, which ends up dripping down the outside of the bottle when you remove the cap. I will replace these bottles with the amber bottles which come with an eyedropper built into the cap. These not only seal better but it's easier to dispense the e-liquid.

      "Statement: \"I've owned a Waterpik water flosser since 2006. I purchased my first one from the oral surgeon who recommended I use it for general oral hygiene and specifically because I had large gum pockets around some of my molars. That first one was a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Model-WP-100/dp/B006HG5A5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Model WP-100</a>, and it lasted six years. It worked quite well until it finally wore out, and I only had to purchase 2-3 replacement&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Jet-Tips/dp/B0062N5AZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jet Tips</a>&nbsp;for it in all that time. The recommended replacement interval for these Jet Tips is 6 months, but I don't replace them if they are still working--the point at which the Jet Tip needs to be replaced is when water dribbles through it instead of in a strong, steady stream, or it won't stay seated in place in the Waterpik handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second Waterpik I purchased in 2012 was a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Model-WP-60W/dp/B000063SLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Model WP-60W</a>. I got it at a local Walgreens drugstore. This model was a problem from the start, because the reservoir was constantly leaking water. I know now, from reading today the excellent manual that comes with this Model WP-900, that my Model WP-60W had a defective reservoir valve and the warranty would have covered replacing it. The problem was, I did return it to Walgreens and exchanged it for another WP-60W, but that one leaked, too, and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of another return, so I kept the replacement Model WP-60W and have been unhappy with its leaking for the past 2.5 years. Since I had purchased my first two Waterpiks locally, and I had not gone online to research Waterpik when I did so, I wrongly assumed when I bought the Model WP-60W that somehow Waterpik had changed the design of their machine and messed up a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the wonders of Amazon, I discovered just this week, when I was looking to replace my Model WP-60W, because I just could not stand its leaking another day, that the reason my second Waterpik was so bad was that I had purchased a bottom-of-the-line model, of far lower quality than my first Waterpik, the Model WP-100, and I learned the different model numbers by looking at the pictures of the various models sold by Waterpik on Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also due to replace my electric toothbrush, and I was fascinated by the information I read about the Waterpik Sonic toothbrush. Waterpik's ad copy on their website and on Amazon claims that the Sonic is much better than the Philips Sonicare, which is the brand I have used for over a decade in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Essence-series/dp/B009TZRQE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Essence series</a>. I had been fairly satisfied with the Sonicare, but mainly because it was the only brand I have ever used, so I hadn't compared it with anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided I would very much like to try the Sonic, but I noted that the price for the Sonic and a Waterpik higher quality water flosser model, when sold separately, would amount to about $170--a pretty steep cost and out of my budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I ran across this model, the WP-900, at a terrific two-for-one price, offering a top-of-the-line Waterpik water flosser plus the Sonic electric toothbrush, and sold by a merchant here on Amazon for a price below retail. I snapped it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It arrived today, and I am extremely impressed. Here are the things I like:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The product is well packed, such that the flosser and toothbrush are well protected, but everything was easily opened--no clamshell horror packing.\n",
      "2. The manual and quick-start guides are well written and well illustrated, and in print large enough that it is actually readable.\n",
      "3. The product is simple to assemble, and the head of the Sonic toothbrush pops off (just pull it off, like taking a cork out of bottle, in an upward motion), compared to having to screw on and off the head of the Sonicare electric toothbrush. The brush head of the Sonicare also gets really sloppy and the inside of the handle has a well which gets very wet and has to be, with great difficulty, scrubbed out to remove mold buildup. There is no such problem with the handle of the Sonic. There is no well in the handle for water to get into.\n",
      "4. The Sonic toothbrush's rechargeable battery arrived 1/3 charged, which was enough to immediately use it. It also re-charges much faster than the Sonicare. It has indicator lights to tell you how charged the battery is, whether 1/3, 2/3 or completely charged, which the Sonicare does not have and which I love.\n",
      "5. The Sonic toothbrush has two speeds, which the Sonicare does not have. This is a terrific perk.\n",
      "6. The brush of the Sonic toothbrush is smaller than the Sonicare, and the feel of the brush, including its size, shape and the vibration of its movement, is exponentially more pleasant and effective to use than the Sonicare.\n",
      "7. This model of the Waterpik is like an expensive sports car beside a jalopy in comparison to the bottom-of-the-line Model WP-60W, and the WP-100 is like a mid-priced sedan in compared to the WP-900. I love the design of the separate, lidded compartments for the water reservoir and one that holds the water-flosser heads and the head of the Sonic toothbrush. The water reservoir comes off easily and fits in place easily, with zero leaking from its valve--what a relief!\n",
      "8. The pause buttons on the Waterpik water flosser and the Sonic electric toothbrush both work much better than those on the Model WP-60W Waterpik and the Sonicare electric toothbrush.\n",
      "9. The price of the replacement brush heads for the Sonic are about 1/4 the cost of the replacement heads for my Sonicare--which is a huge savings over the life of an electric toothbrush.\n",
      "10. The insertion fittings of the Jet Tips of the WP-900 water flosser, compared to those of the Jet Tips for the cheaper WP-60W, are much higher quality, which means that the Jet Tips leak less and last longer.\n",
      "11. This product has a two-year warranty for defects in its construction, and a problem like a defective reservoir valve can be solved at home, by getting a replacement part.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I am in heaven with the great quality of this product. It works so much more effectively than what I've been struggling with previously, that I am able to do my dental care in literally half the time it took me with my Sonicare and Model WP-60W Waterpik.\n",

I swapped it out every few calls with my regular stethoscope ( a Littman Classic II S.E Lightweight) every few calls. This stethoscope works surprisingly well! I truly couldn't hear a difference between this scope and my Littman! Even in the back of a moving ambulance, with the sirens running, I oculd easily and clearly hear breath sounds. This stethoscope is definitely a great buy.\"\n",

Best part is the clear canister - you can see with your own eyes all the dirt coming out of your floor. We have 2 cats, and the amount of cat hair it pulled out of our carpet is scary! After just vacuuming one room that had been regularly cleaned before with our old vacuum, the canister was almost full. My sister has a dyson and she thinks this one pulls out just as much dirt. Only difference will be on hard floor. The rolling brush cannot be turned off, so on hardwood floor you cannot roll the vacuum forward on the dirt. You have to start from the front, and then pull the vacuum towards you. If you are going to use your vacuum primarily for hard floor, I would suggest getting a cainster vacuum such as the Eureka.\"\n",

If you're not a clean freak and you're living in a reasonably-sized pet-free home, this vacuum might be a decent option (particularly at the around-a-hundred-bucks price point).

      "1. Cleaning hose is way too short, and attachments too few. You get a crevice tool and a fuzzy-ended brush, but not a hard plastic upholstery thing. If you're just concerned with your floors, then no foul; however, neatniks will be disappinted by the attachment variety and the almost-unusable hose.\n",
      "2. The foot pedal that powers on/off is in an odd location under where the hose wraps around. If you've got a big foot or clunky shoes on, it's difficult to get to it.\n",
      "3. Dealing with the filter is a pain. And if you have hairy pets, you are going to be doing this a lot! We have to replace the filter entirely every couple of months or the vacuum starts to stink, even though we clean the filter between changes. Reassembling the filter section after a change is also difficult and aggravating, as the plastic pieces are hard to line up (and the more often you change the filter, the more the pieces get misaligned).\n",
      "4. The dump bin holds a reasonable amount, but animal hair gets snagged inside the bin in numerous places. Open the bin over the trash can and---nothing falls out! I have to stick my hand or a tool in and disentangle all the hair clumps. Yuck.\n",

This is the only filament (PETG or PLA) that I've had this much trouble with bed adhesion. Other than that the filament extrudes great at 190-200C and seems less brittle than most other PLA I've tried. I would not recommend this filament if you just want something that works trouble free though it may be worth it for a stronger PLA. It does bridge better than PETG.

      "Statement: \"Love it. I would give five stars but there are no instructions on wiring. I guess they assume you know how. I ended up knocking out several of these while making an automatic bilge switch for my boat. I thought the description stated they could handle 3 amps but a close look and careful reading of the specs indicates they can only handle less than an amp.  Max Contact Rating;is listed as 10W. At 12V that is only .833 Mamp . My bad was connecting them incorrectly to the relay and had them on the load side and the switch. After much consternation I discovered both wires had to be wired to the ON/OFF/ON switch I was using and the center post of the switch getting it's ground from the low side of the relay. Problem solved. Now I have a automatic bilge switch that should have cost me about $2.00 instead of the $44 for a commercial switch and it works flawlessly. I used a 1 1/4 in. piece of PVC pipe approx. 2 1/2 in. long. I first drilled 3/8 in holes in a pattern that evenly covered the diameter of the pipe .....about 4 holes all of the way through...giving you 8 total. I then used a chop saw to cut the pipe at the center of the holes. Using a pipe cap, I flattened the top with a sander, drilled the appropriate sized hole for the threaded stem to go through, attached the o-ring and nut. You must drill a small 1/8 in hole in the top of the cap to allow air to escape so that water can move up and raise the float. NOTE: by default these switches are Normally closed or on. In my case I needed it to be normally open or off. As noted in another review I read, the small white C-Clip comes off and you simply flip the float over...it will now be normally open or OFF.\"\n",

      "Statement: \"This is the first time I've dealt with air-compressor quick connects but this set seems to work well in terms of not leaking.  However, I find the connections to be a little hard to make.  The brass female connector on my air compressor allows a male quick connect from this set to slide in easily and it snaps in place with little force.  On the Legacy connectors, you can't slide a male into a female without pulling the ring on the female end back hard and jamming the male end in hard as you release the ring.  It's a little tricky to release the ring without letting the male end slip back a bit, but if you let it slip, the female end won't grip it and it springs out.  I would reduce my star rating more due to that problem, but these quick connects are so cheap I suppose you can't expect them to use the best design.\n",

      "Statement: \"I received this a day earlier than originally estimated (YEA!).  First reaction, there are a LOT of parts and screws.  I spent ~2 hours a night over 3 days assembling this, making sure everything was aligned as I went.  The parts list (which is a separate PDF from the manual) doesn't really have descriptions for what each part is, so you kind of have to do visual association on some of the extruded pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before it arrived, I went to Harbor Freight and bought a small parts organizer box.  I then spent an hour sorting all of the small bags of screws into this organizer, transferring the labels from the little baggies as I went.  HIGHLY recommend this step, especially if you have a large dog with a duster for a tail (2yr old Husky/Malamute mix here) that constantly brushes up against the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The build overall went very smoothly.  I had also watched all 4 assembly videos from HackAWeek on youtube, although it looks like the manufacture has already made improvements based on his observations (kudos to Hictop for that).  One part I personally recommend, attach the power cord and controller power to the powersupply before mounting the powersupply.  There is plenty of slack, and it is far less awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first print was the supplied test.gcode.  I didn't have a computer setup for the printer yet, and only had my tablet to download and transfer files to SD, but it worked.  The first try failed when the extruder got caught on the masking tape covering the bed, likely due to me setting the PLA preheat too high or putting the masking tape aligned front to back as opposed to side to side.  Second two false starts were because I didn't have the filament inserted all the way, so it wasn't feeding.  Fourth attempt started off ok, but then the base ripped off the bed, creating a mess.  A quick review of the part 4 video on youtube and some quick adjustments to the autolevel sensor, and I restarted again.  This time, everything started working properly.  I took a brief video (~10 seconds) when it was at 15%, then went to bed.  The next morning, I found a nice 4 leaf clover shaped shot glass (pla) sitting on the print bed, very well detailed and smooth on top.  The sides feel rough due to the slicing and printing (like the pages in a closed book), but that can be smoothed with various post-printing touch up techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have now setup a computer station for this setup (Intel NUC with Ubuntu 16.04), and am learning about the slicing process.  I have ~18 inches left of PLA from the sample they provide with the kit, after printing the test.gcode file and two spool adapters from Thingiverse (search for HatchBoxSpindleForAluminumFrameHictopPrusa).  These didn't print with anywhere near the quality of the cloverleaf, but I discovered some default gcode settings that I didn't have when I converted the spindles.  Another learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Having played with Erector sets as a kid in the late 70s - early 80s, and working with extruded aluminum assembly for the last 15 years, this wasn't a big deal for me (actually found it enjoyable).  Print quality seems ok.  No glitches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Manual could be improved.  A lot.  Almost of the images are computer generated, but the components tend to blend, especially when they are the same black color.  For example, the stepper motors don't show the connector, and it is only after mounting them that they show the proper orientation.  I had my X axis fully assembled with the belt tensioned when I discovered the power connector was facing the wrong way.  Easily fixed without having to remove the belt (just loosen the screws and rotate the motor).\n",
      "For belt tensioning, I found a tip that worked very well; tension the belt and ziptie it in place before tightening the stepper motors.  This tightens the belt further by a few mm, which is perfect.\n",
      "The provided version of Cura on the DVD (even though I am a Linux guy and had to get my own copy) is 2 years old.  Get the latest version from Ultimaker (it still supports this printer).\n",
      "Calibrating my autolevel seems to be wrong.  I followed along with the included video, and set it to print a new project, but the head decided to engrave the first layer into the table, as opposed to just pushing filament down.  Will recalibrate and try again.  At least the fine groove can be readily covered by tape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biggest tips:\n",
      "Research and read all of the tips from other users.  Learn from others.\n",
      "I used two old CDs to keep the sample PLA from going everywhere.  Highly recommend this, as the PLA is like a big slinky otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why only 4 stars?  This printer is not for everyone.  I personally know a lot of people that would have given up after organizing the screws.  And there are still improvements that need to happen (manual).  But, being an open hardware design, and seeing the improvements already included Since the assembly videos were made (it would appear that this has the Prussa I3 MK2 improvements already), I think this is an excellent kit for those that want to tinker and learn about the process.  Some of the parts look like they were printed, while others look more refined and were injection molded or laser cut acrylic, suggesting that as parts are refined, they are moved to improved manufacturing processes (the filament sensor housing which is fairly new is a prime example).\n",

      "Statement: \"Many years ago, I used to do custodial work at the Marin Civic Center. One thing I recall (other than the beauty of the place) is the equipment we used, including mops, which were something like this one. Likewise for those I used in the US Air Force. Fast forward about fifty years to today. Looking in most retail stores, one cannot find a decent mop; they are all a bit silly and not very useful. So I was looking more something along the line of this type of mop, which begs for a decent mop bucket with a good wringer. I have a somewhat large basement with a painted cement floor, and I can clean the whole thing in ten or fifteen minutes with this mop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realize that mops are not something people get excited about...at least I don't...but I like a well-made product that works well without much fuss. I also realize that Rubbermaid makes these specifically for commercial use, but don't let that stop you from getting one. In general, commercial-grade products tend to be made better than \"consumer\" products, work better, and last far longer. I learned that if you buy quality, you will buy far less often.\"\n",

      "Statement: \"This is my first oscilloscope.  I started off in Computer Science in college, and programming was my main passion for most of my life.  I only discovered electronics about 5-6 years ago, and it's been my life since then!  I've built many projects involving microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi, single-board computers, etc.  So far, I've gotten by with mainly my voltmeter and studying my circuit issues on paper.  I've delayed getting an oscilloscope for years due to the high cost.  Well not anymore!  I looked into it time and time again, but this particular one caught my eye.  It has very good reviews in the hobbyist community, and seems like a solid choice.  So given my background, I have a solid concept of how I would use it, but have yet to use mine for anything other than learning about it.  This is why I trust the reviews of other more experienced people out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only received my scope a few days ago, and the first thing I did was adjust the compensation of all my probes using the built-in square wave generator, which was cool.  So far everything seems to work as expected, and the device is very well packaged for protection (double-walled box, thick closed-cell foam brackets).  The probes seem quite nice, and work as I would expect.  The manual covers the basics, but it is NOT a oscilloscope tutorial.  I've been poking around the menus and the other basic functions, but there's so much there, I probably will never use most of it.  It's nice to know it's there, though.  The help function is really cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall unit feels very solid.  The screen is very nice - it's got a nice matte surface and the color looks good to me.  It does lose a lot of brightness when viewed from below the screen (ie. when the scope is above you and you need to look up at it).  There's no problem when viewing from above or from the sides by my eyes.  People have complained about the fan, and while it's a little noisy, it's not THAT big of a deal for me.  Yes, I would prefer it was more quiet.  There is info out there on people replacing their fans.  It appears to be a 60mm fan, and I'd probably try to put a Noctua fan in there, since I'm a big fan (pun intended) of theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I confirmed that my probes were basically working, I went online to do my \"upgrade hack\".  My machine is very new, and has software version 00.04.03. SP2.  I can confirm that the online hack DOES work on this firmware version.  As soon as I entered it, the installed options all lost their \"expiration time\" readings, indicating they are permanently functional.  Haven't yet tested them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm hoping to get to know my new scope much more in the upcoming months.  I'll probably start off checking the power rails on a single-board computer I'm building now, and then probably check the system clocks just to familiarize myself with looking at pretty simple signals, and getting the graphs to appear in a way that makes sense to me.  Maybe then I'll get into figuring out how to trigger stuff in a way that makes sense.\n",

The manufacturer has dialed in a set of parameters that just work. And work well!\n",

This machine is solid.\n",

This will clean away any possible oils or debris that could prevent adhesion to the surface you want to apply the reflective tape to. Do not apply this tape in cold weather as this will not adhere to cold surfaces. I tried this and it did not work, I just wasted tape. This does not stick to sharp corners but rounded work well.  I like this product and have purchased multiple colors and widths.  The contrast gets attention even during daytime use.\n",

      "\n",
      "I bought it for my kitchen, which is large - about 300 sq. ft with white 12\" tiles and white grout. (No, we didn't build it that way. We bought it that way. It is very pretty when kept up though so I can see why the original owner chose it.) We also live on an acreage in a rural area. We get dust because we live in a rural area with lots of farms.  Keeping that white floor nice was a constant challenge.  Until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't plan to use the Braava to damp mop our wood floors because I clean them with a solution made especially for wood floors.  I do dry mop the wood floors with the Braava though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been pleasantly surprised with how well the Braava is cleaning. I've only had her a couple of weeks but she is already a member of the family and I would feel a loss without her. My husband named her Mabel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing she was coming, I carefully cleaned the floor before she got here, to give here a good start.  I had cleaned my floor on my hands and knees with a steam cleaner because that was the only way I could clean the dirt from the grout. So with that preparation before she came,  I was completely surprised at how dirty the cleaning pad was after her first clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLEANING GROUT:  She moves easily across the grout and between tiles and does not get hung up.  I thought that she might push dirt into the grout lines and make them look dirtier.  That has definitely has not been the case. She seems to make those troublesome white grout lines look even better than I was doing them myself on my hands and knees.  I'm very pleased with the cleaning of the white grout lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOLUTION: Although I saw on Amazon that a cleaning solution can be purchased, I've just been using tap water.  The water alone seems quite adequate.  Even so, I have been spritzing the floor lightly with a weak Pine-Sol solution because I like the clean smell.  I am not feeling a need to purchase anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "REPLACING A HUMAN:  She does not totally replace a human, but she does an admirable job with a small amount of human care and assistance and has been keeping my white floor looking very nice.  Actually, now I'm not sure I'll have to do much actual full-on mopping very often at all.  It's a good idea to wipe up spills as they happen and before they dry though.  She isn't very heavy so cannot scrub hard.  She's really a damp mop, not a scrubber so if your floors are cluttered with \"stuff\" that would make it difficult for her to move around or if you neglect them regularly your experience might be different.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESERVOIR: I'm very glad I got the 380t because it comes with a water reservoir to keep the pad wet. I would have been less satisfied, I think, if the reservoir didn't come with her.  That said, the reservoir keeps the cleaning pad nicely damp, even in my large kitchen.and on hot days. I've not used warm water for cleaning at all -- it seems silly in a small reservoir that will cool quickly.  The cool water is working well.\n",
      "\n",
      "BATTERY: The fully charged battery cleans a l-o-n-g time.  It really has lasted a full 2+ hours when damp mopping and 3+ hours when dust mopping. I was expecting the claim of a long charge to be hype but was wrong.  I've very happy with how long a charge lasts. In fact, so far, it hasn't run out of enough charge to complete every task I've thrown at it\n",
      "\n",
      "NOISE:  The Braava is so quiet you could put her to work in the bedroom of a light sleeper and it would not wake the sleeper. Sometimes I still check on her to be sure she's still working because I can't hear her.  There is almost no noise at all.  You can easily keep the television or radio at normal sound while she's working.\n",
      "\n",
      "DRY MOPPING: .  Again, I am very pleased at the good job she does dry mopping my wood floors..  The Braava does not vacuum up the dirt but instead works like a dust mop.  I was skeptical that it would be enough. She manages my cat's hair very well.. If you have debris on the floor, or the floor is badly cluttered with boxes, trash cans, and \"stuff\".she'll only be able to clean the areas she can reach and would probably leave paths around clutter she has to work around so you may be less happy with results.  I have been equally as pleased with her dry mopping as with her damp mopping.  In fact, I have a Neato I use for vacuuming.  I had a Roomba but replaced it with a Neato.  In my  opinion I don't think there is any comparison - the Neato has it hands down, so I wasn't at all sure I'd be happy with the Braava because it's also an iRobot.  As it turns out, I like the Braava better on my wood floors than I do the Neato.  Again, I have been surprised.  My Neato is wonderful on carpets though -- I wouldn't trade it. But now that I have used the Braava on my hardwood floors, I prefer using it there.\n",
      "\n",
      "CLEANING PADS: Two cleaning pads come with the Braava.  A white one for dust mopping and a blue one for damp mopping.  They are very different from each other and really have been designed for different uses. The white cloth is very soft, something like what a baby would be if flannel and silk had a child and is without nubbies.  The blue cloth has nubbies, almost like small kind-of stiff chenille fingers for cleaning. Initially I thought I would just use Swiffer cloths, or my own microfiber towels. After using the ones that came with my Braava, I've changed my mind.  It's a matter of size and holding strips in the right places.  The cloths that came do a very good job and adhere well.  I'll be using the cloths that came with the Braava and will be a few buying extras.\n",
      "\n",
      "OUT OF THE BOX:  The instructions were easy to follow and there was very little setup. She even came fully charged so, eager as I was to try her out, I could put her right to work..\n",
      "\n",
      "WALL EDGES:  She cleans wall edges from an angle, rather than following straight along the wall.  This is an area I think could be improved but for the most part it's good enough. The cleaning cloths are just enough wider than the pads, allowing them flex, that that they actually clean edges quite well..\n",
      "\n",
      "FLOOR MAPPING:  She cleans using short back-and-forth motions, slightly angled right one pass and slightly to the left on the next pass much as we might do if we were pushing a mop. Her movements around the room seem a little random and she seems to jump around the room, some, as she cleans. So far I haven't decided if she really goes back to missed areas, but she does it well enough that I can't tell for sure unless I'm watching a whole cycle.  I've not watched long enough yet to know for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROBLEMS I'VE HAD:  One problem I've encountered is that places under my cupboards are not equal distance from the floor in all places. There are 3 places under my cupboards where she gets stuck.  When this happens, she sits and waits patiently for me and does not call for help so I have to discover her since she's so quiet I don't hear her cleaning.  I haven't decided how to manage this problem yet.  I'm thinking of getting hard sponge from the packing store, cutting it to size, and placing them strategically so she can't try to clean in the toe plate where she'll get stuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other problem I've encountered is that there isn't quite enough elevation between the carpet in the dining room and the wood floor so she goes part way onto my very light-colored carpet with her soiled dust cloth.  I don't like that.  So far she'll only go a short distance (a few inches) and turns around and comes back to the wood floor.\n",

I used it to repair fiberglass and vinyl body pieces on a motor home and it did not adhere very well. The one drawback is the setting speed. It is very hard to cut it knead it and apply it before it hardens. If you take the time to press it firmly in place and smooth it you may find that it has gone brittle and won't hold up or stick. You need to work fast and if you are doing more than a tiny repair you need to work in smaller sections to avoid having it harden before you can get it in place. A ten or fifteen minute version would be better. Who is in that much of a hurry?\n",

They are not fussy about temperature and feed perfectly. The spools are large and wide so they lay straighter than a smaller, wider spool and they fit better in gallon ziplocks. This is the only brand I have managed to finish a spool of and I will throw away my yellow and black and replace them with Solutech. The order has been placed and will deliver tomorrow. I am sort of a newby but have run at least five spools through and I think I am getting the hang of it. I can get this brand to print really well.

It functions exactly as stated, and I used this to replace a mechanical thermostat in a chest freezer that I kept outdoors. The hookups are fairly simple, but note that the temperature controls a circuit that behaves like a relay instead of actually sending 120v to the appliance. This is good and bad depending on your application. Good because it allows you to control 12V or 48V dc devices using the relay circuit.

If they had a more concentrated version of this that could treat multiple tankfuls at a similar cost then this would be a 5 Star product\"\n",

I live in a high humidity area during the summer, usually 80% - 95% all summer long.  The gel packs had turned red by the end of the summer.  I nuked them both in the microwave at the lowest power setting for three minutes while I watched them.  They were hot and steaming!  They are blue again and ready for reuse.  However, I would warn anyone to be careful microwaving these.  Even the lowest setting on many microwaves is too high and will melt the plastic if you put them in for the suggested 5 minutes.  You must take caution and try microwaving in short intervals to see if it gets too hot.  You may have to spend a lot of time turning the microwave on and off to prevent the case from getting too hot.  But spending 10 minutes heating these once every 3 months is worth it.

Do yourself a favor and get a few accessories. http://www.amazon.com/In-line-power-switch-2-1mm-barrel/dp/B00KLDPX8U (got mine from adafruit at https://www.adafruit.com/product/1125). This will give you a switch to turn off the printer without unplugging things. Get some filament... I have tried and found the Hatchbox filament on amazon to work very well. However the filament holder arm that comes with the printrbot will not fit hatchbox spools. The hatchbox filament holder is not that much and if you have prime it is free shipping. Only needed if you are using their filament. It will work for other brands as well. I sit it next to my printer and run it over the arm provided to feed down into the extruder. If you have a raspberry pi or have been curious about playing with one the grab one with a decent SD card and the camera. Then lookup octopi octoprint and have fun. By building out an octopi setup you can have prints run independent of your laptop/desktop computer. It is also possible to setup Octopi to be reachable remotely via the web if you want to be able to monitor/cancel print jobs from afar. You shouldn't leave your prints... but anything real fun will likely take hours... so it is one of those don't do it but pretty much every does kind of things. Octopi means you can keep tabs from your phone. If you want to try and do it all from the raspberry pi then get a 2... otherwise a B+ works just fine. Get some painters tape (3\" width makes it quicker to setup) or masking tape. The 3D print Removal tool that shows up in your amazon searches for pretty much any 3d printing is a worthy little tool. With it and a bit of patience I am able to get most prints off the bed without having to re-apply the tape.  printrbottalk.com is your friend for help. Instructables also has a lot of specific help for this model, and 3d printing help in general.\"\n",

      "Statement: \"This shop vacuum deserves a five star rating based on performance, but the company has managed to save money by having no quality control system.  Mine arrived with two incorrect parts and had I noticed the problem at the early stages, I would have packed it up and returned it.  But I was well into assembly by the time I recognized the problems.  The most serious problem involved the factory installation of two left wheel locks in stead of one left and one right wheel lock.  As one can see in the pictures below, both wheel locks have the step plate going in the same direction.  I did not notice this problem until I completed installation of the left wheel and upon adding the right wheel noticed it would not go all the way in because the wheel lock had the step going towards instead of away from the wheel (see the second picture below).  I solved the problem by cutting off the section that extends towards the wheel and it still works just fine.  But the consumer should not be required to do remanufacturing to get things to work.  The second problem was that only one of the wheel nuts that was included was a lock nut.  The others were all regular nuts and a lock nut is required to hold the wheel on as a regular nut, if tightened down, would prevent the wheel from turning.  A lock nut can be tightened just enough to keep the wheel on while allowing for free rotation.  I solved the problem by using a thread sealer that served to hold the nut in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "After suffering through assembly, I then used the Shop Vac to clean the basement floor and the work room.  It worked beautifully, and was very impressive in terms of suction and the extensions and attachments were of high quality.  Indeed, the 8 foot hose is the best vacuum hose I have every seen.  Thus, I gave the unit 5 stars for performance and 3 stars for pain and suffering during assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My strong recommendation is that you carefully check all the parts including the installed parts and if anything is missing, return it to Amazon for replacement.  It is very hard to tell through the plastic whether you have a lock nut or a regular nut, however.  But the lock nuts are a lot thicker and have small round marks on two faces which are indentations to make the nut hard to turn on the screw.  The company should be dinged for using such a cheap lock nut, and dinged even more for not including the right number. Fortunately, if you or going to buy a shop vac from a company with no quality control, Amazon is a great place to buy such a thing because replacement is so easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unfortunate that something that works so well once assembled is shipped without paying attention to the details, but I still recommend this item because it works so well.  It is very solidly built, and moving it up and down the stairs is quite easy because of the design, excellent handle and large rear wheels.  Storing all the attachments inside is also very convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, just make sure you have all the parts before starting to assemble.  And for the cretin who will invariably add a comment that I am the fool for not checking the parts before assembling, I was indeed partially to blame.  Let this review prepare you for the fact that this company seems to lack quality control during assembly and parts preparation.  But once you get the thing put together, this is indeed a 5 star shop vac.\"\n",

      " - It's small and lightweight\n",

      "- Okay, it is fairly quiet as any \"duster\" vacuum would be...\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      " - When attempting to empty the canister the debris and \"yuck\" just stays stuck in it.  I shook the canister many times to get it out but the debris barely moves.  There is really no way to get a firm hold on the canister to shake it.  I ended up needing to hold the canister upside down between my knees (so the opening is facing up) and dig it out with my hands.  I'm a transplant patient who has a low immune system and I really need to be careful of germs and dust.  This was NOT fun to do!  I used to own a Shark canister and both ends opened up on the canister so that you could push the debris through if it got stuck.  Most of the debris I vacuum up is cat hair... and this is after all made for pets, but only if you have pets that barely shed... Maybe I should try to find a good lightweight bagged vacuum because not many upright bagless work well with pet hair?\n",
      "- The power is not as strong as I thought it would be.  It's great on hard surfaces, but poor suction on carpet.  It barely lifts the pile.  I need to go over items several times before it will pick up.  I want a vacuum to be strong enough to pick up small tufts of cat hair without the need to break my arm doing it...\n",
      "- You would think a vacuum of this price and reputation would have a way to attach the cord higher up so that it does not get caught up under the wheels... just sayin'\n",
      "- Using the hose is a nightmare!  Most vacuums with hoses are pretty easy to unhook the hose, vacuum up what you need with the hose then attach it again to continue with your job...  This hose is inside or part of the handle, and the difficult part is getting the hose back IN the handle after using it.  Then while the hose is out the vacuum is so lightweight it is not steady.  It literally feels like when you unhook the hose that the vacuum is falling apart.\n",
      "- It does not do good on edges.  The power just doesn't seem strong enough to pick up even a small piece of paper unless it's directly under it.\n",
      "- The canister is very small and needs dumped out after vacuuming 2-3 rooms.\n",
      "-  It is expensive for what you get.  Definitely not a powerhouse vacuum for daily use unless you have VERY little to clean up.  I'm a clean person and I don't let things get too bad, but living in a state with a lot of dust and \"nature\" blowing in, it is a constant battle...\n",

      "I really really really wanted to like this vacuum!!!! I've heard only good things about this brand.  I have debated whether to send it back or not.  It is not easy for me to box it up and get it shipped back due to my failing health.  I may just have to keep my older Hoover Windtunnel bagged for heavy jobs (which is highly rated from ASPCA for pets) and this one for light days and dusting the ceiling fans.  But, it is kinda high priced for that.  And, I shouldn't have to keep 2 vacuums.  If the Hoover was lighter I wouldn't have even considered the Dyson actually....\n",
      "I do feel badly that I cannot give higher marks for this... I truly wanted to say it's the best vacuum I've over owned...\"\n",

      "Statement: \"I am a proud owner of flashforge Creator Pro, Flashforge Finder and now Dreamer first let me talk about Flashforger support and company, no ,matter what is your problem and how long you own your printer flashforger support always there to support and help you solve your problem that's why I have all the 3 printers by them and any new printer release they will have I will own too, thank you Mr. Tang.\n",
      "all printers has issues and will have issues from nozzle jam to extruder movement issues, and be sure that flashforge team is there with you.\n",
      "now my review for the printer, I gave it 4 star rating and 1 star extra for flashforge support lets get to the pros and cons\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. sizable build volume with the price you pay.\n",
      "2. 100 micron and can really go to 75 micron at slower speed no problem I tried it, and give good quality resolution\n",
      "3. Flashprint software that come with it is great slicer, I my self love Simplify3d but the flashforge print is no less.\n",
      "4. low price for a good quality printer good looking and ability to use all types of filaments to your heart contents.\n",
      "5. active cooling system and heated bed and wireless connection, SD card print and USB port printing, easy to use menu.\n",
      "6. bed leveling is easy, not automatic but as easy as it gets for such printers.\n",
      "7. Dual extruder, although I find the use of dual extruder limited, but its an option, and this printer do it very will, other dula extruder printers you would pay double the price and many failed at it.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. spool size and location inside the printer, it the worse feature of it but you can always overcome it by printing upgrades like I did or use external spool holder, flashforge filament is not bad at all but lacks the colors I like and there is much better quality of filaments if you have the money for it, also printing with exotic filaments such as laywood, laybrick, brass, copper, ...etc they have spool sizes that won't go to your printer, but the problem is solved if you have the patient and don't mind to print from outside\n",
      "2. the plastic frame of the printer, I really not a fan of this plastic frame, creator pro and finder has a better quality frame, although this printer look good but come on the frame makes it cheap and I am always worried it melt from the heat although I know its unlikely.\n",
      "3. the touch screen has an SD inside the printer some times it move out of place when it shipped, this happened to me and it renders the printer touch screen to be white and not work, I had to open the bottom cover and fix it, and now it work great but its not fun to open a new item you just bought to fix it, I wish this issue be solved in future versions of this printer.\n",
      "\n",
      "here is links to spool upgrades that I love and helped me use 3rd party filaments:\n",
      "1. [...] my favorite which I am currently using and its working great\n",
      "2. [...] another great for PLA or ABS external spool holder my second best\n",
      "3. [...] just a spool holder which is good really good holder idea\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope my review helps and please comment for questions\n",

I would have expected the accuracy to be a little better in the lower range since the product description does state that it works for \"0-99, 999 RPM\".  However, it did allow me to get in the ballpark of where I was looking for in finding the RPM of the parts I was looking at.  One thing to note with this, if the surface you are attempting to measure is reflective at all, you'll get a lot of bad readings.  You have to find some way to eliminate the reflections so that the only reflective surface it is reading is the tape that you place on it.  This is really to be expected because of the method of measurement, but it seems important to note.  The surface doesn't have to be mirrored, I was having some issues with this on some slightly glossy plastics.  I found that a coating of baby powder often did the trick, but this might not work on all parts or with very high RPMs.  Plus, I would hesitate to dirty up some moving components like that.\"\n",

      "Statement: \"Let me start of with the meat, in case you are not interested in the potatoes below.  This unit works great, right out of the box.  It took me perhaps a couple of hours to go from box to first print.  My first print was very nice -- I just used the default \"Low\" resolution settings for everything and the provided sample of PLA filament.  One of the very cool features of this latest model Robo (R1+) is Auto Bed Leveling Compensation - which basically means that the machine goes through a automated sequence prior to each print to determine the flatness of the print bed and then compensates for any deviation in software automatically.  Now, I thought this was pretty cool until I noticed that my X-Axis smooth rods were not very parallel to my print bed (one side was higher by about 3/4\") and I had not noticed it for my first few prints.  It looked like either the x-end was not fully seated at the factory or had become dislodged during shipment.  The cool thing was it did not even matter, the printer had compensated for this fairly large offset and the parts that I had printed were all excellent quality - I literally could have left it as is and operated normally.  Well, it was an easy fix -- loosen one screw and push the x-end down further onto the z-axis lead-screw coupler.  I feel this is an excellent printer, especially for someone who may not be particularly inclined to have to do all of the tweaking and calibrating common to some of the lower end units or build-it-yourself kits.  If you do like to dig down into the \"guts\" of your stuff and tinker, like I do, its also a great unit, because everything is pretty much right there in front of you, just in a nice looking package.\n",
      "Switching filaments is easy - it has an all metal hot end, so printing ABS or PLA is not an issue, nor should some of the newer exotics.  I have yet to try Flexible filaments, but I did try wood.  The included software works fine, but this is an open-source unit, so you can easily use Cura, Pronterface or any other software.\n",
      "Potatoes--Although fairly new to the 3d printing community, I think I started off like many frugal engineers/tinkerers, lost of research to figure out how best to get the most bang out of my buck.  I was intrigued by being able to prototype stuff quickly, but i wasn't willing to drop $2k on a new hobby, that frankly might not be my thing; so I bought a used Prusa i3 RepRap (assembled from a kit) off of Craigslist for $200.  After some bit of tweaking and wiring fixes, this unit worked well, but I constantly had to manually tweak the bed level and extruder springs -it was really kind of a pain.  This unit was my step up, from kit to commercial unit, but did not require not a $2000 investment.  I am very glad that I did, for the $700 (on sale) price, I got a unit that is almost hands-off, plug-and-play printing.  In addition, it is open-source and uses a lot of the same electronics, extruders and  hot ends I am already familiar with.  I could not be happier with this unit.  There is also a large community of users that so far all seem to be good makers (willing to help others).\n",
      "I have contacted their customer service dept (via email) for some additional info and found them (shout out to Jerry) to be responsive and helpful.  If you want a great printer for a great price, you cannot go wrong with the Robo 3d R1+. HH\"\n",

      "It comes in a little plastic case, along with a mini screwdriver and some pH buffers so that you can calibrate it precisely. It also comes with instructions for calibration and use, and the 4 1.5V batteries it needs come pre-installed. For me it was working right out of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing I did was calibrate it. I picked up some distilled water, and measured out 250 mL into a glass jar. Luckily, I have a little kitchen scale so I could be precise. I poured in the 6.86 solution, stirred until it dissolved, and placed the tip of the meter into the solution. It measured nearly 7, and so I used the screwdriver to adjust the levels on the back end of the meter. It's easy enough to do, but I did have to hold the tip of the meter into the water with my right hand and make adjustments with my left while I was bent over checking the reading until it hit 6.86. Then I cleaned off the tip with the electrode sensor by dipping it into the more distilled water, waited until it dried, and then went through the calibration process again with the 4.01 buffer. This time it was a lot closer, but I still had to make a minor adjustment, and then it was ready.\n",

It's a handy tool for your budding scientist, and likely useful for all kinds of other things.

Now that I know what I am doing I am confident I would do the swap inside of 10-15 minutes. You really must make sure everything is lined up correctly and facing the correct way before you tighten everything down or you will have issues with the filament jamming up or snagging different things. Also when I started to print I realized that every print was causing a jam. After 3-4 failed attempts I realized it was because the entire unit was heating up and causing the filament to clog. I cranked the fan attached to the heatsink on the front up to 100% to keep it cool and haven't hasld a jam or clog again. (Knock on wood)\"\n",

This particular board, however, it just awful. I understand the supplier is probably hand soldering these together in large batches every day, but the quality of work and parts used on this are simply the worst I've seen. The screw terminals were crooked and not seated properly to the PCB. One of the screw terminal outlets had a bent inner flap and didn't work right at all until I bent it back into place with a screwdriver. The caps just behind the power input were haphazardly soldered in with so much of the legs of the components showing that they shorted out against one another. The MOSFETS were similarly badly soldered and came all crooked and smashed down on top of one another on the board. The female pin headers for the stepper drivers for the E1 and E2 positions were crooked and required some adjustment to accept the driver properly.\n",

The adhesive makes it stick to almost anything. I would not recommend using these on painted walls. The hook/loop system works just like the Velcro strips.

      "Statement: \"I've had this Taulman black filament for months now, and finally found a need to try it.  This Taulman 910 nylon filament prints like PLA but requires far more heat at the extruder, around 250C-255C, with a bed temperature around 45C.  It is also claimed by Taulman to be hard, like PLA.  Previous experiences with Taulman nylon filaments were very favorable so I went with their suggestions.  The results were excellent.  With a layer of Elmers X-treme gluestick on the print-bed and everything heated to specifications, this printed very well on the first attempt, with absolutely zero warping.  The gluestick holds it to the print-bed surface very well, even after the finished part had cooled, requiring some persuasion to remove the part from the print surface.  Lesson learned!  The claim to be as hard as PLA is probably a bit of an overstatement, but it's certainly harder and stiffer than other nylon filament I've used, and scraping a fingernail down a sharp edge caused no problem, at all.  This is only a 1-pound spool and is considerably more expensive than most 2.2-pound spools of PLA and ABS from other vendors.  That's about the only down-side of this product.  Unfortunately, at this time there are only two color options, black and \"natural\".  Except for the temperatures used, this was a 'plug-n-play' replacement for both PLA and ABS needs.  It prints similar to PLA but feels more like ABS. For printed parts that need more heat resistance, such as around the hot-end heater block, this should offer better performance than ABS, which is usually used in those areas.  This is also a high-strength filament, so this Taulman 910 filament should shine when more strength is needed.\"\n",

No, these rags are not made out of cotton but are a felted wood fiber. They are super absorbent, better than cotton, and when you get them cruddy you can just toss them rather than face the wrath of your significant other after you run a bunch of oily rags through the washing machine! They are not affected by oils, alcohol,  or any solvent you might find in normal shop use. One great benefit, at least for me, is that they do not \"shed\" little pieces of fiber like cotton rags do when you are applying,  or cleaning up, stains or wipe on finishes.

      "Statement: \"The hose was lightweight and expanded to full length with water pressure. The elastic nature of the hose kept a little water pressure after water was turned off so be careful not to remove nozzle without releasing water first or you will get soaked. The hose dispelled all the water automatically fastest when both ends are open. I was surprised to see all the bad reviews, the only cons I've seen were the fabric exterior just didn't seem like it should be dragged through mud. A regular hose would rinse more easily. I've even left it pressurized for several days and noticed no leaks. I'm writing this review as I'm about to purchase another 50'. I've used it several times but never abused it fully with tugging, vehicles etc. This hose wouldn't work well with a reel i imagine, the reel would restrict expansion and contraction limiting water flow. I'm surprised there was no mention of that in the description/ instructions. I don't like having to disconnect the hose every time im finished with it, even though it shrinks considerably, lying on the floor by the spigot just dosen't appeal to me\n",

      "Statement: \"I bought this unit to measure several useful things- the temp of my grill, my home freezer, attic temp (to check on insulation and powered fan thermostat temp), etc.  This is a very useful device, more than you would think!  While not having done science experiments to calibrate the temps (did not use ice in a black cup to check 32degrees F nor boiling water to check for 212F), it seems to be fairly accurate.  The walls next to my home thermostat exactly match what this and the thermostat say are the same temp.  Its prime us for me is to check my attic space temps, as I have installed new soffits vents and roof fans so I need to know the temp.  Interestingly I found that the air/roof temp at the apex of my attic space is 20 degrees hotter than at the hip/base of the roof!  I have an infrared burner on my grill and its temp exceeds the max 716F of this unit, but I know it is working.  Also, my regular grill thermometer seems to be correct, according to this.  The electronics seem to be generic- there are many units that have the identical 12:1 angle of view and the exact 716F maximum temp.  I chose Etekcity because I was previously happy with a different electronic device they sold me.  This unit was inexpensive, but feels expensive with the non-grip surface.  This is no toy.  You can also squeeze and hold the trigger and wave the gun around to find the \"hot spot\" of whatever it is you are looking at.  I find this very useful\"\n",
